<h1>About Me</h1><hr />
<p> Hi, I m Saniya Siddiq! 
    I am currently pursuing a degree in engineering, driven by a deep passion for technology and problem-solving. From an early age, I have been fascinated by how software and applications work, which led me to explore the world of programming. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a strong aspiration to become a full-stack developerâ€”someone who can build and manage both front-end and back-end technologies seamlessly. 
    My Journey in Engineering Studying engineering has provided me with a solid foundation in logical thinking, analytical skills, and problem-solving. I enjoy learning about different technologies, understanding how systems work, and developing solutions that can have a meaningful impact. My coursework has given me exposure to various programming languages, software development methodologies, and the fundamental principles of computing.
